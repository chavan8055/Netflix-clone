# Netflix-clone
I have created a **Netflix Clone** using only **HTML and CSS**, replicating the look and feel of the Netflix UI. The project features a **responsive homepage** with a sleek and modern design, including a **hero section with a background image, call-to-action buttons, and a navigation bar** similar to Netflix. The content is organized into various sections such as **featured movies, trending now, and popular categories**, using **flexbox and grid layouts** to ensure a structured and visually appealing interface.  

The design includes **hover effects, smooth transitions, and overlays**, enhancing user interaction. A **mock login page** with a simple form design is also included to replicate the authentication experience. The layout is fully **responsive**, adapting to different screen sizes for both desktop and mobile devices.  

While this project does not include functionality like video streaming or dynamic content loading (since it's built with only HTML and CSS), it serves as a **great front-end UI project**, demonstrating skills in **layout structuring, styling, and responsive design**. This Netflix clone can be further enhanced by adding JavaScript for interactivity or integrating a backend for dynamic content. ðŸš€
